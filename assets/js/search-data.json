            "content": "Topic 3.12 (3.A) Calling &amp; Understanding Procedures - Kaiden &amp; Amay . Overview: Learning Objectives . Basics of Procedures | Calling Procedures | Determine Results of Procedures | . What is a procedure? . Essential Knowledge: . A procedure is a named set of instructions that can take in parameters and return values. May be called &quot;method&quot; or &quot;function&quot; in different programming languages. | . | Parameters are independent variables used in the procedure to produce a result. It allows a procedure to execute without initially knowing specific input values. | Procedures can be classified as sequencing, selection, and iteration. How? | . Example: . What is the procedure&#39;s name? | What are the parameters? | What did the procedure return? | . x = 5 y = 3 def multiply(x, y): product = x * y return product answer = multiply(x, y) print(&quot;The product of&quot;, x, &quot;times&quot;, y, &quot;is&quot;, answer) . The product of 5 times 3 is 15 . Calling Procedures . To call a procedure you would write the name of the procedure followed by the parentheses with the parameters of the procedure | Procedures do not require parameters, but the parentheses must be there | . Ex: . procedureName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) | How would you call this procedure? | . num = 5 def math(x): op1 = x * 2 op2 = op1 - 9 return op2 . Quiz (Part of Hacks) .

Determining the Result of a Procedure . To determine the result of a procedure or any code, you must follow the code line by line and see what each one does . | Using syntax, you can determine the result by . function parameters | return value and statements | . | . To use return values, you have to write the syntax return followed by the expression you would like to return var | . A return statement exits a function and instructs python to continue executing the program and to return a certain value . | Value can be string, a tuple, or any other type that is being sent back to the main program . | . Ex: . def divide(num1,num2): x = num1/num2 return x . what is x being assigned to inside the function? . | As a reminder, to use function parameters, you would have to write the syntax name of the function followed by the parameters needed in parentheses . | Function parameters are the parameters that are used when calling the function in order to get a result. . | . What are the function parameters in this procedure? . What values are being passed to the function? . def function(first_name, last_name): print(first_name + &quot; &quot; + last_name) function(&quot;Peter&quot;,&quot;Parker&quot;) function(&quot;Safin&quot;, &quot;Singh&quot;) . Peter Parker Safin Singh . In the cell above, the function is being called twice, which shows the importance of function in order to accomplish the same thing with different parameters. . What is wrong with the function? . Can you translate the binary numbers into decimal notation? . def find_cube(num): result = bin(num * num * num) return result cube = find_cube(3) cube2 = find_cube(4) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube) print(&#39;Cube:&#39;,cube2 ) . Cube: 0b11011 Cube: 0b1000000 . Once again, I called the function twice, which is useful, because it allows the coder to do the same thing multiple times with different arguments. . Topic 3.13 (3.B) Managing Complexity - Safin . Overview: Learning Objectives . increasing code modularity using procedures abstracting large problems into smaller ones | extract shared features to reduce code duplication | . | using parameters to reuse procedures | improving code readability with procedures | manipulating procedure logic and preserving outputEssentially, we&#39;ll learn how and when it is appropriate to construct a function (procedural abstraction) and what its benefits are . | . Vocabulary: . Modularity - the practice of breaking a complex program into smaller, independent parts or modules that can be used and reused in different parts of the program | Abstraction - the practice of hiding the details of how a particular code or system works and exposing only the essential features or functions that are necessary for other parts of the program to use | Duplication - having multiple duplicate code blocks, often decreasing readability and efficiency | Logic - the sequence of steps and operations that a computer follows to execute a program, including the specific instructions and decision-making processes built into the code | . Parameters . As we saw above, parameters can be used to make functions work with multiple different inputs. Let&#39;s review the following code . # these parameters are the inputs to the function, and they are used # inside the function to perform some operation def add(x, y): # inside the function, we can use the x and y parameters just like # we would use any other variable result = x + y return result # to call the function and pass in values for the x and y parameters, # we simply provide the values as arguments in the function call result = add(2, 3) print(result) # should output 5 # we can also use variables as arguments in the function call x = 5 y = 10 result = add(x, y) print(result) # should output 15 # we can even use the result of one function call as an argument # in another function call result = add(add(2, 3), add(4, 5)) print(result) # should output 14 . 5 15 14 . In the above example, parameters were used to create a function that could be called multiple times without code duplication. . Modularity . In the following example, we will use specialized functions and explain their benefits: . import math def hypotenuse(leg1, leg2): # notice we&#39;re using this &lt;var&gt; * &lt;var&gt; syntax multiple times? # this has multiple drawbacks: # - it&#39;s repetitive and makes the code longer # - if we wanted to change the operator being # applied to `leg1` and `leg2`, we&#39;d have to do it twice! leg1_squared = leg1 * leg1 leg2_squared = leg2 * leg2 return math.sqrt(leg1_squared + leg2_squared) ## VERSUS ## # this works, but let&#39;s try to write the &quot;squared&quot; variable assignment statements more concisely... def square(a): return a * a def hypotenuse_abstracted(leg1, leg2): # not only is this shorter, but we can now: # - better understand the code at a glance--we know exactly # what `square` should do # - change the operator in a single place (`square`) rather than # multiple times within this hypotenuse function leg1_squared = square(leg1) leg2_squared = square(leg2) return math.sqrt(leg1_squared + leg2_squared) ## EXTRA CHALLENGE ## # is it possible to write the `hypotenuse` function in a single line? def hypotenuse_abstracted2(leg1, leg2): # ... pass assert hypotenuse(3, 4) == hypotenuse_abstracted(3, 4) == 5 . Abstracting Shared Features . Say we want to create a set of functions that count the number of words in a sentence that start with a certain character. We want to create... . count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(sentence) | count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(sentence) | . In order to count words starting with a certain character, we&#39;ll first need to split up the sentence into words. This behavior will be shared across both functions we intend to create, so procedural abstraction is appropriate here. . # is a separate element in the list def split_string(s): # use the split() method to split the string into a list of words words = s.split(&quot; &quot;) # initialize a new list to hold all non-empty strings new_words = [] for word in words: if word != &quot;&quot;: # add all non-empty substrings of `words` to `new_words` new_words.append(word) return words # this function takes a list of words as input and returns the number of words # that start with the given letter (case-insensitive) def count_words_starting_with_letter(words, letter): count = 0 # loop through the list of words and check if each word starts with the given letter for word in words: # use the lower() method to make the comparison case-insensitive if word.lower().startswith(letter): count += 1 return count # this function takes a string as input and returns the number of words that start with &#39;a&#39; def count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(s): # use the split_string() function to split the input string into a list of words words = split_string(s) # use the count_words_starting_with_letter() function to count the number of words # that start with &#39;a&#39; in the list of words count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;a&quot;) return count # see above def count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(s): words = split_string(s) count = count_words_starting_with_letter(words, &quot;d&quot;) return count # example usage: s = &quot; This is a test string! Don&#39;t you think this is cool? &quot; a_count = count_words_starting_with_a_in_string(s) d_count = count_words_starting_with_d_in_string(s) print(&quot;Words starting with a:&quot;, a_count) print(&quot;Words starting with d:&quot;, d_count) . Words starting with a: 1 Words starting with d: 1 . In the above example, we have: . defined several functions that perform different tasks related to processing a string | abstracted away shared behavior for both functions that count the number of words starting with a specific character in a string | . Topic 3.13 (3.C) Developing Procedures - David &amp; Alex . Overview: Learning Objectives . parameters being used to manage complexity parameters storing variables | parameters storing arguments | . | calling functions with procedure names choosing procedure names | calling procedures in python and javascript | . | . Vocabulary: . Procedure - a module of code that is created to complete a certain task, this is basically a function | Procedure Name - the name that is given to a function/procedure | Parameters - a variable that is used in a function to allow for data to be imported into a function | Arguments - a way to provide information to a function, usually defined outside a function and then imported into a function with parameters | . Functions - Basic Structure . Functions can be created in many different languages. Below are some examples in Collegeboard&#39;s format, Python, and Javascript. . Collegeboard . Above, the function is defined as PROCEDURE, which tells the coder that this is a function. The function is then named with procName, which is simply how the function is identified. parameter1, parameter2,... are variables that can be predefined elsewhere and repeatedly used in the same function. This will be gone over later in the lesson so don&#39;t worry if you don&#39;t get it. block of statements are just things that you would place inside a function to complete a certain task, such as print() in Python. . Python . def function(a,b): # function is defined print(a+b) # prints output of variables function(1,2) # one instance that it can be used function(2,3) # another instance . 3 5 . Python is similar to the Collegeboard example, where def defines the function, function, and then is followed by parameters a,b, which can later be interchanged with any numbers as shown with function(1,2). The numbers are called arguments, which are information provided to the function with parameters. In this case, the parameters are being added within the function and then printed. . Javascript . function Function(a,b) { return a + b; } Function(1,2) Function(2,3) . 3 5 . Javascript in this case is almost the exact same as Python, the only differences being that function is called with function and that the formatting is a little different. Otherwise, it does the exact same thing as the Python example. . Example . function div(a,b) { return (a+b)/2 } div(3,7) . What is the procedure name? | What are the parameters? | What operation is being done? | what would the output of this code be? | . Parameters . In functions, there are sometimes parameters that the functions have in which you can call to the function giving arguements that will provide input to the function For example: | . def function(num1, num2): if num1 &gt; num2: print(&quot;num1 is greater than num2&quot;) elif num1 &lt;num2: print(&quot;num1 is less than num 2&quot;) num1= 6 num2 = 8 function(num1,num2) . num1 is less than num 2 . In this function, it takes in two parameters num1 and num2 | Whithin this function it uses conditionals to determine if num 1 is larger or smaller than num2 | When calling to this function we must put in two arguements, num1 and num2 respectively | We put in 6 for num1 and 8 for num2 and the algorithm runs and gives us an outcome | . This basic function in python can be recreated in Javasript . function compare(a,b) { if(a&gt;b) { console.log(&quot;a is greater than b&quot;) } else if (a&lt;b) { console.log(&quot;a is less than b&quot;) } } // How do you call to this function? . what are the parameters? | What is the output? | what are the arguements? | . Calling functions . When calling functions, you have to ask yourself some questions Does the function have any parameters? | does the parameter have output? | . | Depending on these answers, the way you will call to a function will be different | . Example where it does does have parameters and gives output . def InchestoFeet(inches): Feet = 0 Feet = inches / 12 return Feet result = InchestoFeet(24) print(result) . 2 . If you look closely, there is a return at the end of the function, this returns a value when you call the function | This is why we have to set a variable, in this case result equal to the output of the function. | Also one thing to notice is that this function also takes in a parameter called inches | . Here&#39;s an example of calling functions in HTML with Javascript: . HI . . &lt;!-- function is called here --&gt; &lt;button id=&quot;enter&quot; onclick=&quot;print(a,b)&quot;&gt;HI&lt;/button&gt; &lt;p id=&quot;result&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;!-- javascript --&gt; &lt;script&gt; function print(a,b) { document.getElementById(&quot;result&quot;).innerHTML = a + b // math } // variables are defined var a = 1 var b = 2 &lt;/script&gt; .

Today we will be looking at algorithms from another standpoint. . Main Idea 1: Algorithms can be written in different ways and still do the same thing . However, Algorithms that look similar might not always have the same result | Different algorithms can be used to solve the same problem | . Examples . The goal with the two algorithms below is to show &quot;Wow! Good job!&quot; when you get an A and show &quot;Nice!&quot; when you get a B or C (pass), if you don&#39;t pass (lower than 70) it will show &quot;Do Better&quot; . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) if 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . What Grade Did You Get? Nice! . Yay! it worked! Lets look at the next one. Do you notice any differences? Do you think this algorithm will still achieve the same goal? If not, what is the flaw? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) if grade &gt;= 90: print(&quot;Wow! Good job!&quot;) elif 70 &lt; grade &lt; 90: print(&quot;Nice!&quot;) elif grade &lt; 70: print(&quot;Do Better&quot;) . What Grade Did You Get? Do Better . So, why is this important? Why are we even doing this? . When 2 algorithms look extremely similar, it is easy to assume they do the same thing. However, that is not the case and we have learn how to notice small differences in code and pretty much debug. . just know that codes that look similar don&#39;t always produce the same things :) | . Real-life situation (Storytime) . Tommy and Billy are working on solving the same issue with an algorithm Tommy creates a functioning code and yells &quot;I did it!&quot; He looks over at his friend Billy which is having a bit of trouble and he offers help However, Billy&#39;s code looks basically the same! which confuses them Then they remeber that they were taught that algorithms that look similar don&#39;t always have the same results and they collaborate to do further investigation:) . Now, without running, investigate the algorithm below. This one looks different. Do you thing it will still achieve the same goal as above? . print(&quot;What Grade Did You Get?&quot;) grade = int(input(&quot;Enter Grade:&quot;)) A = grade &gt;= 90 B = 70 &lt;= grade &lt; 90 C = grade &lt; 70 if A: print(&quot;Wow!

Review of Selection and Iteration . Algorithms with iteration repeat a function until a goal is reached To more easily represent an algorithm without showing all the repeated steps, we can use iteration | . | Algorithms with selection only go through certain functions if certain things are true or false | . Example 1 .

Knowing existing algorithms can help construct new ones | simple existing algorithms can include determining min or max of two or more numbers | computing the sum or average | identifying if an integer is even or odd | . | Using existing correct algorithms can help as building blocks to reduce development time, testing, and identification of errors | . Create an algorithm that will start with any positive integer n and display the full sequence of numbers that result from following the Collatz Conjecture. . Example: 6 -&gt; 3 -&gt; 10 -&gt; 5 -&gt; 16 -&gt; 8 -&gt; 4 -&gt; 2 -&gt; 1 . What does this function do? . if (n MOD 2 = 0) { display(&quot;n is even&quot;) } else { display(&quot;n is odd&quot;) } . By modifying the preexisting code, we can write create new code that follows th Collatz Conjecture. .

Determine the result or side effect of iteration statements | Learn how to use iterations with for loops and while loops | Creating code to learn how to incrementally list numbers | Learn the range function and using variables in code | . Definition: Iteration Statement - cause statements to be executed zero or more times, subject to some loop-termination criteria . The first function we will learn is the range function, which we will use with for loop. As you may be able to guess, this will give us the sum based on the input provided. We always use a variable, such as i, to represent what the range of numbers the output will show. For example, if I wanted to list the numbers from 1-10 using the range function, it would look like this: . for i in range(7): print(i) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 . Now with while loops, we can provide a similar output with a variation in the input. Similar to for loops, it requires a variable which is the starting value. . i=1 while i&lt;=10: print(i) i=i+1 . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . pets = [&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot;, &quot;snake&quot;] for i in pets: if i == &quot;fish&quot;: break print(i) . cat dog .

Suppose there are n rooms to search... number the rooms 1-n . | Start by searching in room number 1 . | Search each room thoroughly for you item. . | Change the room number to the next highest number . | Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have found your lost item. . | Enjoy the lost item. . | WAIT! There is a flaw in the program. . This is where a stopping condition is useful for when the iteration already meets the desired requirement and gets out of the loop. . Programming Examples . i = 0 while (i &lt; 5): print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) i = i + 1 . Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! . i = 0 while (i &lt; 3): #Try changing the 5 and see what happens! print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) i = i + 1 if (i == 5): #Try Changing the 3 and see what happens! break . Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! . These are just a few examples of what you can do with iteration. . Summary: . An Iteration is a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | We can use stopping conditions to stop an iteration if a condition is already met | . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 - Parav Salaniwal . Lesson Objectives . Determine the result or side effect of iteration statements | Learn how to use iterations with for loops and while loops | Creating code to learn how to incrementally list numbers | Learn the range function and using variables in code | . Definition: Iteration Statement - cause statements to be executed zero or more times, subject to some loop-termination criteria . The first function we will learn is the range function, which we will use with for loop. As you may be able to guess, this will give us the sum based on the input provided. We always use a variable, such as i, to represent what the range of numbers the output will show. For example, if I wanted to list the numbers from 1-10 using the range function, it would look like this: . for i in range(7): print(i) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 . Now the first thing you may notice is my input for the range was 11, and you may wonder why is it not 10? This is because when using the range function, the last number, or the ending value, is not included in the output, therefore we would have to add 1 to receive the correct output. Now if we were looking to include a starting value to have it start from 1 and end at 10, the code would look like this: . for i in range(1,11): print(i) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . When using the range with for loop, the you can list much more than just a increment of one, would anyone like to guess how we could include a change in the incremented value? Try making a change in the python code above to change the incremented value. When using the range function: . for i in range(3, 11, 2): print(i) . 3 5 7 9 . Now with while loops, we can provide a similar output with a variation in the input. Similar to for loops, it requires a variable which is the starting value. . i=1 while i&lt;=10: print(i) i=i+1 . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . Based on your knowledge from for loops, which values in the code above are the starting, incrementing, and ending values? . LESSON . . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 - Nikhil . Here is some basic code I have created, let&#39;s first look into this one: I created a list of pets, cat, dog, fish, and snake. Then I created a for loop, &quot;for i in pets&quot; and this looks at every element/value in pets, so &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot; and &quot;snake&quot;. This next if statmenets checks if the element in the list is &quot;fish&quot; and if it is, it breaks the loop. The statement would just print, cat and dog since the loop breaks at fish. . pets = [&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot;, &quot;snake&quot;] for i in pets: if i == &quot;fish&quot;: break print(i) . cat dog . This while loop checks if number less than 10 is even and if so, it will print out the even numbers. We set a starting value of number = 0, then while the number is less than 10, the percent sign means modulus so meaning if there is a remaninder when we dvide. So if number divided by 2 has no remainder then it will print number. Then after that it will add 1 to the number and repeat the process untill it reaches 10. So let&#39;s check for 0, while 0 is less than ten, then it moves to next statement, since 0 divded by 2 has a remainder of 0 it will print the value of 0. Now it will add 1 to zero. Then it will see that 1 is less than ten, and then check if 1 divided by 2 has a remainder of 0 which it does not, so it skips the print, and goes straight to addding one, so on so forth. . number = 0 while number &lt; 15: if number % 2 == 0: print(number) number += 1 . 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 . The purpose of this code is to find the sum of all the even numbers between and any number of your choosing. The integer input asks for the minimum and maximum value. The next statement puts a starting sum value set to 0. The for i in range (minimum,maximum+1) looks at every number between those two values, in this case 1 and 100. Then the if i modulus 2 checks if any numbers that are divisible by 2 and the remainder comes to 0. If there is a number that has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, it adds that number to the sum. Then the last print statement, prints out the final sum of all even numbers between the two numbers of your choosing. . minimum = int(input(&quot;please enter a minimum number you want your range to be&quot;)) maximum = int(input(&quot;please enter a number that you want to be the maximum value&quot;)) sum = 0 for i in range(minimum,maximum+1): if i % 2 == 0: sum += i print(&quot;The sum of all the even numbers between&quot;, minimum, &quot;and&quot;, maximum, &quot;:&quot;, sum) . The sum of all the even numbers between 5 and 6 : 6 . LESSON . . HACKS Unit 3 Section 8 . Hacks Unit 3 Section 3.8.1 .

An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) . Frontend (View Simulation) and Hacks . This python codes tests endpoints on a server. This can be handy for development and testing when making modifications to the Jokes Web APIs.

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . &quot;&quot;&quot; Requests is a HTTP library for the Python programming language. The goal of the project is to make HTTP requests simpler and more human-friendly. &quot;&quot;&quot; import requests &quot;&quot;&quot; RapidAPI is the world&#39;s largest API Marketplace.

Go deeper into APIs . Web Development vs Jupyter Notebook. A notebook is certainly a great place to start. But, for your end of Trimester project we want you to build the skill to reference and use APIs within your Project. Here are some resources to get you started with this journey. . In the Nighthawk Coders APCSP you can find an Overview and Examples using APIs:APCSP APIs menu- Using Covid RapidAPI JavaScript frontend API code in APCSP Fastpages GitHub repo: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/APCSP/blob/master/_posts/2022-07-10-PBL-rapidapi.md | . | Making a Jokes API (this will next API tech talk) Frontend. JavaScript frontend code in APCSP fastpages GitHub repo: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/APCSP/blob/master/_posts/2022-07-10-PBL-jokes.md | Backend Endpoints. Python code that allows Frontend access: https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/flask_portfolio/blob/main/api.py | Backend Jokes Management. Python code that support Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD): https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/flask_portfolio/blob/main/model_jokes.py | . | . Hacks . Find and use an API as part of your project. An API and a little coding logic will be a big step toward getting meaningful data for a project. There are many API providers, find one that might work for your project to complete this hack. When picking an API you are looking for something that will work with either JavaScript Fetch or Python Request. Here are some samples, these are not qualified in any way. . RapidAPI- GitHub Project | No Key APIs Article | Twitter Developer | Google Developer | Reddit Developer | . Show API and format results in either Web Page or Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, I will expect that we do APIs in backend (Python/Flask). However, for this Hack you can pick your preference. We will discuss pros and cons in next API tech talk. .",

Variables all have a type: String, Integer, Float, List and Dictionary are some key types. In Python, variables are given a type at assignment, Types are important to understand and will impact operations, as we saw when we were required to user str() function in concatenation. . Developers often think of variables as primitives or collections. Look at this example and see if you can see hypothesize the difference between a primitive and a collection. | Take a minute and see if you can reference other elements in the list or other keys in the dictionary.

List and Dictionary purpose . Our society is being built on information. List and Dictionaries are used to collect information. Mostly, when information is collected it is formed into patterns. As that pattern is established you will be able collect many instances of that pattern. . List is used to collect many instances of a pattern | Dictionary is used to define data patterns. | Iteration is often used to process through lists. | . To start exploring more deeply into List, Dictionary and Iteration this example will explore constructing a List of people and cars. . As we learned above, a List is a data type: class &#39;list&#39; | A &#39;list&#39; data type has the method &#39;.append(expression)&#39; that allows you to add to the list. A class usually has extra method to support working with its objects/instances. | In the example below, the expression is appended to the &#39;list&#39; is the data type: class &#39;dict&#39; | At the end, you see a fairly complicated data structure. This is a list of dictionaries, or a collection of many similar data patterns. The output looks similar to JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Jekyll/GitHub pages yml files, FastPages Front Matter. As discussed we will see this key/value patter often, you will be required to understand this data structure and understand the parts. Just believe it is peasy ;) and it will become so. | . InfoDb = [] # InfoDB is a data structure with expected Keys and Values # Append to List a Dictionary of key/values related to a person and cars InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Luka&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Van Den Boomen&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;September 29&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;jmortensen@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;none&quot;], &quot;Phone&quot;: &quot;858-705-5029&quot; }) print(InfoDb) # Append to List a 2nd Dictionary of key/values InfoDb.append({ &quot;FirstName&quot;: &quot;Sunny&quot;, &quot;LastName&quot;: &quot;Naidu&quot;, &quot;DOB&quot;: &quot;August 2&quot;, &quot;Residence&quot;: &quot;Temecula&quot;, &quot;Email&quot;: &quot;snaidu@powayusd.com&quot;, &quot;Owns_Cars&quot;: [&quot;4Runner&quot;] }) # Print the data structure print(InfoDb) .

Formatted output of List/Dictionary - for loop . Managing data in Lists and Dictionaries is for the convenience of passing the data across the internet, to applications, or preparing it to be stored into a database. It is a great way to exchange data between programs and programmers. Exchange of data between programs includes the data type the method/function and the format of the data type. These concepts are key to learning how to write functions, receive, and return data. This process is often referred to as an Application Programming Interface (API). . Next, we will take the stored data and output it within our notebook. There are multiple steps to this process... . Preparing a function to format the data, the print_data() function receives a parameter called &quot;d_rec&quot; short for dictionary record. It then references different keys within [] square brackets. | Preparing a function to iterate through the list, the for_loop() function uses an enhanced for loop that pull record by record out of InfoDb until the list is empty. Each time through the loop it call print_data(record), which passes the dictionary record to that function. | Finally, you need to activate your function with the call to the defined function for_loop(). Functions are defined, not activated until they are called. By placing for_loop() at the left margin the function is activated. | . # print function: given a dictionary of InfoDb content def print_data(d_rec): print(d_rec[&quot;FirstName&quot;], d_rec[&quot;LastName&quot;]) # using comma puts space between values print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Residence:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;Residence&quot;]) # t is a tab indent print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Birth Day:&quot;, d_rec[&quot;DOB&quot;]) print(&quot; t&quot;, &quot;Cars: &quot;, end=&quot;&quot;) # end=&quot;&quot; make sure no return occurs print(&quot;, &quot;.join(d_rec[&quot;Owns_Cars&quot;])) # join allows printing a string list with separator print() # for loop algorithm iterates on length of InfoDb def for_loop(): print(&quot;For loop output n&quot;) for record in InfoDb: print_data(record) for_loop() .

Alternate methods for iteration - while loop . In coding, there are usually many ways to achieve the same result. Defined are functions illustrating using index to reference records in a list, these methods are called a &quot;while&quot; loop and &quot;recursion&quot;. . The while_loop() function contains a while loop, &quot;while i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot;. This counts through the elements in the list start at zero, and passes the record to print_data() | . # while loop algorithm contains an initial n and an index incrementing statement (n += 1) def while_loop(): print(&quot;While loop output n&quot;) i = 0 while i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) i += 1 return while_loop() . While loop output John Mortensen Residence: San Diego Birth Day: October 21 Cars: 2015-Fusion, 2011-Ranger, 2003-Excursion, 1997-F350, 1969-Cadillac Sunny Naidu Residence: Temecula Birth Day: August 2 Cars: 4Runner . Calling a function repeatedly - recursion . This final technique achieves looping by calling itself repeatedly. . recursive_loop(i) function is primed with the value 0 on its activation with &quot;recursive_loop(0)&quot; | the last statement indented inside the if statement &quot;recursive_loop(i + 1)&quot; activates another call to the recursive_loop(i) function, each time i is increasing | ultimately the &quot;if i &lt; len(InfoDb):&quot; will evaluate to false and the program ends | . # recursion algorithm loops incrementing on each call (n + 1) until exit condition is met def recursive_loop(i): if i &lt; len(InfoDb): record = InfoDb[i] print_data(record) recursive_loop(i + 1) return print(&quot;Recursive loop output n&quot;) recursive_loop(0) . Hacks . Add a couple of records to the InfoDb | Try to do a for loop with an index | Pair Share code somethings creative or unique, with loops and data. Hints...
