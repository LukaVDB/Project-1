    "1. What is an IP address? An IP address is a internet protocol that is used for communication between different computers. \n",
    "2. What is a TCP port? A safe way to send your information over the internet. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Slide Questions\n",
    "1. What does DNS stand for?\n",
    "- DNS stands for domain name system\n",
    "2. What is the purpose of DNS?\n",
    "- Change the domain ip (123.131431) to something my legible. ex. youtube.com. \n",
    "3. How does DNS work?\n",
    "- Your computer sends a message for another machine so that you can get the ip address of the site you are trying to reach. This then gets returned to your browser which is used to get to you desired site. \n",
    "4. What is a DNS resolver?\n",
    "- A DNS resolver is helps find the associated ip address and its domain name. First step in above process. "
