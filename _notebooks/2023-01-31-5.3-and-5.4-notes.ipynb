    "**Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?**\n",
    "- Facebook is more oriented towards the older generation. This is because that when facebook came out, it was for a younger age group but they grew older while still using the platform causing its age group to also increase. \n",
    "- Tik tok is now also targeted to the younger generation like how Facebook was originally. \n",
    "- This is good bushiness for the companies because they keep their same group of users over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Some of the ways that these age groups are getting older is because the user base is also getting older. For example, when facebook started to get popular it was advertised to people who were attending college. These people would continuously use facebook throughout their lives so facebook would keep targeting this age group who was getting older. This older age group would then prevent the newer generation from getting facebook because they are not their main audience and the age gap did not interests the youth. These youth would then be more interisted in other platforms that are targeted to them like Tik Tok."
