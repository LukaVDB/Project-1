    " * A variable is an abstraction inside a program that holds a value, where each variable has associated data storage that represents a single value at a time (However, if the value is a collection type such as a list, then the value can contain multiple values).\n",
    " * Variables typically have meaningful names that helps with the overall organization of the code and understanding of what is being represented by the variables\n",
    " * Some programming languages provide a variety of methods to represent data, which are referenced using variables 9Booleans, numbers, lists, and strings)\n",
    " * One form of a value is better suited for representation than antoher.\n",

    "A variable is an abstraction made inside a program that holds a value. These variables are used in code to refer to more comples values that the variable contains and makes the program code more organized and smoother to run.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables can be seen as \"containers\" and each container has a name that holds what it is supposed to hold.\n",
    "In the following code, we can see that a variable has the value of \"Alex.\" How can we make the variable appear more organized in the code?"
