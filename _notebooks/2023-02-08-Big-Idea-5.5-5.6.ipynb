    "1. When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog.\n",
    "- In the license file, it talks about the distribution, use and reproduction of this license. It allows you to make modifications, cannot modify the license, give credit. \n",
    "2. In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic.\n",
    "- It is good to have credit to the owner but it would also prevent creativity because whenever someone has an idea but it is copyrighted, they cannot produce the good idea that they have. \n",
    "3. Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update.\n",
    "- I want to make an opensource project that allows users to use our project and hopefully improve the work that we have done. \n"
