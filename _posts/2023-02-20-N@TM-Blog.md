# N@TM Blog

## Presentation reflection
- Overall, our project was able to have various people look at our projects and had good improvements compared to my project from the first trimester. I liked how our project was very interesting to some people because they were also very interested in the stock market. The backend for my feature did not work completely yet so I was unable to gather data from the others.
