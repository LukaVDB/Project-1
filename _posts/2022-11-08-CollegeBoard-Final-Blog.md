# Welcome To My CollegeBoard Final Blog


On the CollegeBoard Final I got a 39 out of 50 possible points. 

# Question 6

- My answer is wrong because it would go over the max amount possible. The right answer is to print all positive odd integers that are less or equal to the max because it would first count to 1, then repeat until it reaches the max and display it and add 2.

# Question 8

- My answer is wrong because it would not change the values of j and k correctly. The second answer would return the correct values since it changes the two keys and its values. 

# Question 14

- Number 7 would not give the right output, it is supposed to give check, but instead it would give check minus. Number 6 would still give the right output of check.

# Question 17

- Open protocol internet does not ensure that the transmission is secure. Open protocols would allow for a standardized way of data transmission for different devices.

# Question 19

- You need more than 4 bits to represent the sum of 14 and 15.

# Question 21

- All of the options are true because binary can also represent audio recordings.

# Question 23

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Screen Shot 2022-11-09 at 8.46.10 PM.png)

- Values change smoothly not discretely, can be measured periodically which are called samples. 

# Question 35

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Screen Shot 2022-11-09 at 8.51.47 PM.png)

- The past line sets MaxPS to 50 regardless of what is above. Instead it should be at the top.
