# Plan
- I plan on making a site that helps students with organization for assignments in school
- This site will be able to organize students assignments and classes
- It would also let students know if a assignments is coming up or an exam that they need to prepare for
- This app would also have students be able to take notes for all of the classes that they have so they could be prepared for all of the things that they have going on. The app would also help with creating students schedules so they can stay organized and on task to make sure they can finish all of their assignments on time.

# What Will This App Have
- This app will have a calendar
- Schedule
- Note taking section
- exam alerts
