- At the night at the museum, we introduced our project of the interactive calendar to various students and parents at the event. They would input different pieces of data which the program would send back in the correct date in the calendar. 

# What Did I See?

- This is an image of another project that I had seen at night at the museum. It is a drawing of someone holding a lighter underneath a drawing of the earth. I think it is very well done since it has lots of detail and is very creative since most people would not think of drawing something similar to this.
