# Planning

- I want to ask different questions about European and international soccer 
- Images on each screen
- Try to incorporate images as buttons
- Test to check if all of the buttons work correctly
- Make a screen for when the wrong answer is selected and when the game is finished

# Problems That I Had
- When I had changed either the name of the button or screen the code would also have to be changed
- I also had problems with adding certain images because they were the wrong image type
